    <p>Many people consider drop shipping to be a business model and this is incorrect. Drop shipping companies are simply retail companies: they buy products at a low price and re-sell them at a higher price for profit. The only difference between drop shipping retailers and traditional retailers is that drop shipping retailers do not hold any stock or inventory; they act mainly as middlemen.</p>`,

This blueprint focuses on selling physical, low-cost products but you can apply these same strategies to sell high-ticket items, info products and even services. Many gurus teach the sale of "winning products" and many students stress over what to sell and spend days if not weeks and even months trying to find their own winning products. Here's the thing: <em>any product can be a winner with the right marketing</em>. Remember the LIVESTRONG bracelet? The product was simple and extremely low cost (less than $0.01 per unit), and it was not a very compelling product at all: a silicone bracelet with the word "LIVESTRONG" stamped on it. The marketing behind this product resulted in 80,000,000 sold. 80 Million. Let that sink in. Imagine if you came up with a product that sold 80,000,000 at a profit of only $0.10/unit <em>after</em> product cost and advertising expenses. That would be a profit of $8,000,000. Eight. Million.

    content: `<p>Once you have decided what to sell you have to find out who can supply it for you. The purpose of drop shipping as opposed to traditional fulfillment methods is to sell a product without holding any inventory, thus significantly lowering your overhead. Some drop shippers make arrangements with local sellers or sellers on websites such as Etsy or eBay to ship products to their customers for them. The vast majority, however, utilize a website called AliExpress.</p><p>AliExpress is an online retailer in which manufacturers sell their mass-produced products individually. It's kind of like paying the bulk price for a product instead of the individual item. Let us say, for example, that you need to buy a new case for your phone. Many people would go to the mall and find one of those kiosks selling phone cases. These cases usually cost $20-30 each, and that is not a bad price for something you use every day. Here is the thing: those phone cases more than likely were manufactured in China, and the mall kiosk paid far less for those cases than they are selling them for. AliExpress gives you access to the mall kiosk's pricing instead of what you as a consumer would normally pay. A phone case that is $20 at the mall will cost you less than $5 on AliExpress. The only downside is shipping times. Ordering products directly from China means that you will have to wait a bit longer to receive it. Most items can be shipped with a service called <em>ePacket</em> which typically delivers the products to the US within 2 weeks. Here are the benefits of using AliExpress to source your products:</p><ul><li>Lots of options. AliExpress has thousands of products for you to choose from</li><li>Low prices. You are basically paying just over the bulk price for individual items</li><li>Seller ratings. You can see which sellers are reliable so that you know whether you want to do business with them</li></ul><p>All you have to do once you decide on a product to sell is determine how you will fulfill this product. Using AliExpress, you can find a product and a seller that you can order that product from every time you make a sale. This way, all you have to do is keep placing orders and your customers will receive their products without you ever seeing the item in person.</p>`,

You need customers who will purchase what you are selling. Without customers your business is worthless. Luckily, there are a few ways to let people know about the products that you are selling so that they can buy from you. The method taught in this blueprint is paid advertising. This is not as intimidating as it sounds: for a very low budget (I've gone as low as $5 per day), you can show a photo or video of your product to people using various websites, apps and social media platforms. Once your ad is in front of the people that are interested in what you are selling, they will click through to your e-commerce website and buy your product. This blueprint will focus on one of the most powerful advertising platforms in existence: Facebook. Facebook ads are an extremely powerful method of putting your product in front of potential customers and getting them to click through to your e-commerce store. Facebook's platform has so much data on its users that you will be able to target specific demographics. If you are selling a dog collar, for example, you can simply tell Facebook's platform to show your product to people interested in dogs.

    content: `<p>One of the biggest problems for beginners in e-commerce is product selection. Most people want to make sure that they select the <em>perfect</em> product that will go completely viral, change lives and help them to retire on a private island somewhere. While this is undoubtedly the best way to go, you really should not stress selecting the perfect product to sell. Instead, find a product that you know you can market well. For example, if you are passionate in a specific niche (hiking, for example), consider a product in that niche. As an avid hiker, you will be able to best get inside the minds of your target audience, thus creating better ads and calling attention to the best selling points of your hiking product. Go through any category of products that you think you may be able to market effectively and make a list of the products that jump out at you. Getting traffic from paid advertising is mostly <em>cold traffic</em>. This means that your potential customers are not actively looking for what you are selling, therefore you have to stop them from what they are busy with (scrolling through their social media feed/chatting with friends) and interest them enough to make them click away from the social media application and into your e-commerce website. For this reason it is extremely important that your product is a <strong>scroll-stopper</strong>: something that stops someone from their scrolling and intrigues them enough to read your ad instead of trying to skip past ads as many people do. Pick a product that looks amazing in photos OR can be easily demonstrated in videos so that you can turn casual social media users into active customers.</p>`,

I would also target "Camping", "Fishing", just about anything that my demographic may be interested in. The goal is to get inside the mind of your customers.
